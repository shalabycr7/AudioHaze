# Audio Signal Processing App
###### This Is A Simple GUI Application To Manipulate Audio Files By Modifying The Audio Wave Form And Display It Using Python

## Requirements
##### Install FFmpeg
* You Need To Install `FFmpeg` From This Guide [Install FFmpeg on Windows](<https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows>)

## > Core Features
* Show Audio File Information Such As:
  * File Type
  * Number Of Channels
  * Audio Frame Rate 
  * Maximum Audio Amplitude
* Modify The Audio File By:
  * Increasing/Decreasing The Amplitude
  * Increasing/Decreasing Audio Speed
  * Increasing/Decreasing Audio Delay (Shift)
  * Reversing The Audio
  * Add An Echo Effect
* Represent The Audio Wave Form For Both Original And Modified Files
* The Ability To Play Both Audio Files
* Text To Speach Functionality
* Export Both The New Modified Audio File And The Transcript TTS File In A New Directory `Audio output`
* Convolution Operations For Some Elementary Signals
* LTI System Functionality:
  * Convert Between Zeros And Poles Formula To H (s) Represented In Numerator/Denominator Formula
* Support For Stereo Audio Files
* Support Dark Mode Theme
